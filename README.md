# Anaemia Prediction Dataset
## Overview
The Anaemia Prediction dataset contains medical records of patients, providing various health metrics that can be used to predict the likelihood of anaemia. 
This dataset is suitable for binary classification tasks in supervised learning.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of several records with columns representing different attributes related to the health status of the patients. Here's a description of each column:

1. Number: A unique identifier for each patient.
2. Sex: Gender of the patient (M: Male, F: Female).
3. %Red Pixel: Percentage of red pixels in the blood sample image.
4. %Green Pixel: Percentage of green pixels in the blood sample image.
5. %Blue Pixel: Percentage of blue pixels in the blood sample image.
6. Hb: Hemoglobin level in g/dL.
7. Anaemic: Presence of anaemia (Yes, No) - (1 for anaemic, 0 for not anaemic).

## Learning Outcomes
From this dataset, we know this dataset is supervised learning Target = Anaemic, Target column is categorical column
